**FAQ Chatbot for Customer Support**

## Project Description
This is an intelligent FAQ Chatbot developed for customer support, built with FastAPI as the backend and React + Vite for the frontend.

Users can interact with the chatbot, browse categorized FAQs, and submit feedback on responses.
## Features

- **FAQ Categorization**: Organized FAQ categories accessible via sidebar filter.
- **User Feedback Logging**: Tracks user feedback with a "Was this helpful?" button.
- **CSV Upload**: Users can upload FAQ datasets in CSV format for dynamic updates.
